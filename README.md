# WEEK 1-4 Competitive programming(Project ID:139) Schedule 

---


### Week 1: Programming Foundations & Core Techniques
- Practiced basic logic-building exercises in C++.
- Created and refined a personal competitive programming (CP) template.
- Learned usage of C++ STL containers: `vector`, `array`, etc.
- Introduced to foundational concepts:
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Two-pointer Approach
  - Basic Bit Manipulations

---

### Week 2: Sorting, Searching & Divide and Conquer
- Strengthened understanding of:
  - Basic Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)
  - Searching Techniques including Binary Search
  - Sliding Window Technique
- Explored STL utilities like `sort()`, `binary_search()`, `lower_bound()`.

---

### Week 3: Greedy Algorithms & Introduction to Dynamic Programming
- Studied the **Greedy** approach with problems like:
  - maximum sum & boring day(sorting + greedy )
  - stone game (2 pointer + greedy)
  - thorns and coins (prefix sum)
- Understood where greedy strategies work and when they fail.
- Started basic **Dynamic Programming (DP)** concepts:
  - Memoization 

---

###  Week 4: Binary Search & Its Applications
- learnt **Binary Search** patterns:
  - Classic search on sorted arrays
  - Lower and Upper Bounds
  - **Binary Search on Answer**
- solved variety of problems:
  - brightness begins(binary search on answer)
  - sushi for two(greedy + binary search)
  - lets watch football
