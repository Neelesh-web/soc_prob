# WEEK 1-4 Competitive programming(Project ID:139) Schedule 

---


### Week 1: Programming Foundations & Core Techniques
- Practiced basic logic-building exercises in C++.
- Created and refined a personal competitive programming (CP) template.
- Learned usage of C++ STL containers: `vector`, `array`, etc.
- Introduced to foundational concepts:
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Two-pointer Approach
  - Basic Bit Manipulations

---

### Week 2: Sorting, Searching & Divide and Conquer
- Strengthened understanding of:
  - Basic Sorting Algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)
  - Searching Techniques including Binary Search
  - Sliding Window Technique
- Explored STL utilities like `sort()`, `binary_search()`, `lower_bound()`.

---

### Week 3: Graphs & Greedy Algorithms
- Learned Graph representations (Adjacency List/Matrix).
- Implemented core traversal algorithms: **BFS** and **DFS**.
- Solved problems involving:
  - Shortest paths in unweighted graphs
  - Connected components

---

### Week 4: Dynamic Programming & Range Queries
- Understood key DP concepts: memoization, tabulation, state transitions.
- Solved classic DP problems like:
  - Fibonacci variations
  - 0/1 Knapsack
  - Subset Sum
